    <li>Q: Is the Fourth Dimension real?
        <p>A: Four dimensional space is just as real as three dimensional space. What we think of as the 'real world' is our brain processing the
            sensory input it receives. If our brain received the exact same input it receives from the 'real world'
            but from another source, would it be any less real? 

            Virtual reality is reality that doesn't match up to standards that we are used to in our base reality. 


            If a brain  responds to input that corresponds to four dimensional space and is able to generate meaning out of it then it is real.

    <li>Q: Isn't the fourth dimension time?
        <p>A: Anything that can be explored/observed independently of other established dimensions can be counted as an additional dimension.
            For example on a flat LCD screen, color can be thought of as a third dimension since the whole range of colors is available to each pixel on the screen.
            In the case of time, the same space existed and will continue to exist regardless of which time it is observed in, and conversely if given a time,
            the full range of spatial dimension is available to observe, so it too can be thought of as an additional dimension to space.

            3 Dimensions are conceptual, they map conveniently to the input we get from the what we call the "physical world", which is why they were conceived
            in the first place.

            We are talking about four spatial dimensions plus time of course.

    <li>Q: Isn't stereoscopic vision responsible for our depth perception / 3D vision?
        <p>Stereoscopic vision is one of the mechanisms that enables us to see depth. It is particulary useful in
            scenarious where both observer and object are still, and it enables greater depth perception accuracy within 5 to 20 meters of range.
            We are focusing on motion parallax as teh primary mechanism for space depth perception. (example experiment animation)

            This is further complicated by the 'hacking' of stereo vision to display virtual 3D screen as a fundamental of VR technology.
