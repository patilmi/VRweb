                            Rotations in 3D space have 3 degrees of freedom - around the xy, xz, and yz planes, using cartesian coordinates.

                              To the baby without a developed sense of 3D space, the toy appears as if it is changing shape as it turns.

                                the 2D perspective projections of 3D objects

                                The baby with the spinning mobile crib as with other objects begins to see that the turning object is not actually warping,
                                but that it is the same continous object being viewed from different perspectives. 
                              </li>

                            <li>What does it mean to "see" 3D? We can navigate 3D space, which means we see 3D space as continious, can tell which points are close
                                together and which are far apart, which points are which direction from each other etc. The combination of distance and direction
                                lets us navigate 3D space.

                                This intuition of 3D space is what drives the learning algorithm that takes us from point light sensors in our retina (rods and cones),
                                to seeing and imagining full continous 3D space and being able to intuitively navigate it. In the baby's example this developing intuition
                                allows it to recognize its toy from various perspectives, manipulate its toy, and successfully place its toy in its mouth.

                        <p>Rotate virtual objects in 4D space. Objects are represented by point clouds embedded in 4D space. Points in turn are 
                          represented by tiny 4D spheres. Practically a point sphere is represented by a 4 dimensional position vector v like (x, y, z, w)
                          and a radius r.

                          To rotate objects in 4D space we needed a generic and intuitive representation for rotations which was built like this(link to math)
                          Rotations in 4 dimensional space have 6 degrees of freedom. Around the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, and zw planes.

                            A perspective projection onto a 3D screen. (projection diagram)

                              Since the 4D object is a rigid body rotating,
                              it's projection causes a predictable warping that our brains can learn through experience.

                              Learning the 4D object through rotation gives us insights into 4D space so that we begin to intuit and 'see' 4D.
