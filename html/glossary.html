                    <li>Q: Is the Fourth Dimension real?
                        <p>A: Four dimensional space is just as real as three dimensional space. What we think of as the
                            'real world' is our brain processing the
                            sensory input it receives. If our brain received the exact same input it receives from the
                            'real world'
                            but from another source, would it be any less real?
                        </p>

                        <p>Virtual reality designed to mimic our base reality is distinguishable from said base reality
                            because it doesn't live up to expectations
                            set by our experience of base reality. Dreams on the other hand are often indistinguishable
                            from base reality.</p>

                        <p>If the brain is able to generate meaning out of input that corresponds to four dimensional
                            space,
                            then it is real, or at least as real as anything else.</p>

                    <li>Q: Isn't the fourth dimension time?
                        <p>A: Anything that can be explored/observed independently of other established dimensions can
                            be counted as an additional dimension.
                            For example on a flat LCD screen, color can be thought of as a third dimension since the
                            whole range of colors is available to each pixel on the screen.
                            In the case of time, the same space existed and will continue to exist regardless of which
                            time it is observed in, and conversely if given a time,
                            the full range of space is available to observe, so it too can be thought of as an
                            additional dimension to space.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            3 Dimensions are conceptual, they map conveniently to the experience of what we call the
                            "physical world", which is why they were conceived of
                            in the first place.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the purpose of our technology, when we talk about 4D or 4 spatial dimensions, we are
                            talking about four spatial dimensions plus time.

                    <li>Q: Isn't stereoscopic vision responsible for our depth perception / 3D vision?
                        <p>A: Stereoscopic vision is one of the mechanisms that enables us to see depth. It is
                            particulary useful in
                            scenarios where both observer and object are still, and it enables greater accuracy of depth
                            perception within 5 to 20 meters of range.
                            We are focusing on motion parallax as the primary mechanism for space depth perception.


                        <p>
                            This issue is further complicated by the 'hacking' of stereo vision employed as a
                            fundamental of VR technology.

                    </li>

                    <li>Q: Even if we accept that the brain can construct 3D vision from 2D eye input, why should it be
                        able to construct 4D vision from the same 2D eye input?

                        <p>
                            A: There is nothing inherently two dimensional about the input the eyes supply the brain. In
                            fact the input is not even one dimensional
                            because it comes from photoreceptors on the retina. These act like point light sensors and
                            the brain has to make sense of them to
                            convert them into vision.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Though it is a leap to expect the brain to understand 4D space. Given that it is already
                            taking leaps like producing 3D vision from
                            a collection of point light input, with 2D vision as a likely intermediate step.
                            It is reasonable to expect our approach to work because we are trying to build 4D vision
                            using the same process, but instead using 3D vision
                            as an intermediate step.

                    </li>

                    <li>Q: There are other attempts to visualize 4D, what makes this one unique?
                        <p>A: This is not really a visualization technique, it is brain training technology. Most 4D
                            visualization techniques rely on dimensional analogy and
                            attempt to cram a logically conceptualized 4D object into 3D space. An object like a
                            tesseract for example. Others display a disparate series of 3D
                            slices of 4D objects in the hope that the brain will be able to somehow stack the slices
                            into a 4D whole. These approaches miss the time series data
                            inherent to continuous rotation, and fail to consider how the brain managed to
                            visualize/intuit 3D space in the first place. Our technology
                            exploits a continuum of images derived from smoothly rotating 4D objects.

                    </li>

                    <li>Q: Why pursue 4D vision when we live in a three dimensional world?
                        <p>A: Apart from satisfying our curiosity, learning to see four dimensional space could change
                            our understanding of the brain.
                            Learning 4D vision could significantly change the brain itself as it opens up the
                            possibility of intuitive four dimensional problem solving.
                            As the technology matures it also opens up the avenue of a four dimensional metaverse, which
                            is to say it opens up the possibility of a whole new world.

                <h2> Assumptions and speculation</h2>


                <p>It is unclear how much of our human 3D vision algorithm is baked into our DNA, and how much is
                    learned. We are counting on the
                    learning infrastructure being prebaked and not the complete vision algorithm so that we can apply
                    the learning algorithm to 4D space.</p>

                <p>Many of our claims made about the human vision algorithm, like the role of stereoscopic vision and
                    motion parallax,
                    or the notion of 2D vision being a precursor to 3D vision, are based on informal research and our
                    own reasoning. It is likely that
                    experiments to test our working understanding
                    have already been conducted or can be designed. This is an area of further exploration for us as
                    time and resources allow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mathematically, we treat the 4D point spheres as infinitesimal,
                    which we use to calculate their perspective projections as ellipsoidal
                    instead of the more computationally intensive egg shape projection.
                </p>

                <p> Our rotation calculation is numerical so there exists some degree of error accumulation.</p>
