                <p> Our baby's object is a crib mobile. A crib mobile is a colorful spinning toy usually suspended
                    over an infant's crib.

                    The baby's crib mobile spins and holds the baby's attention.

                <p> Our eyes can be thought of as 2D sensors that take in <strong>2D projections</strong> of our 3D world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Without developed 3D vision or depth perception, the baby views its revolving crib mobile as a continuous stream
                    of flat warping images.
                    Its toy looks different from different angles, and since the toy is rotating through different angles,
                    it appears to change shape as it
                    turns.

                <p>As the baby's brain tries to make sense of these warping images, it begins to stitch together
                    the 2D perspective projections of 3D objects.

                    </p>
                    <p>The baby with the spinning crib mobile as with other objects begins to see that the turning object
                        is not warping, but simply being viewed from different perspectives.</p>

                    Recognizing 3D space as continuous,
                    the ability to determine which points are close to one another,
                    and which are far apart, the ability to determine which points are which direction from one another,
                    and the resulting ability to navigate within space, all combine to let us see that space.

                    The baby's developing intuition
                    allows it to recognize its toy from various perspectives, manipulate its toy, and successfully place
                    its toy in its mouth.

        <h3>Now we mimic the conditions that led to the baby developing 3D vision, but do so in 4D space</h3>

            <div class="detail active">
                <p> Our 4D objects are virtual.                    
                </p>

                <p> We build virtual 4D objects by embedding points in 4D space.
                    A point's location in 4D space is represented by a point vector (x, y, z, w).
                    Points in turn are represented by tiny 4D spheres.</p>

                <p>
                    So our 4D objects are point clouds made up of thousands of points arranged in geometrical patterns to form shapes.

        <li class="box"><span>Rotation</span>
            <div class="detail">
                
                <p>
                    To rotate objects in 4D space we need a generic and intuitive representation for rotations which
                    we constructed as shown in the essential math section below.
                    
                </p>

                <p>Rotations in 4 dimensional space have 6 degrees of freedom - around the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, and zw
                    planes (rotations in 3D space have only 3 degrees of freedom - around the xy, xz, and yz planes)
                </p>

                <p>As the object rotates, the distance between any two points in the point cloud object remains the same. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="box"><span>Projection</span>

            <div class="detail">
                <p> 
                    We project the 4D object onto a 3D screen, which can be rendered on a VR headset.
                </p>

                <p>The same way the baby saw warping 2D projections of his rotating 3D toy,
                    our technology will show you warping 3D projections of a 4D object.</p>

                <p>It is important to remember that in both the 3D and 4D case, the object doesn't actually warp, only its projection warps as the object
                    rotates through a range of angles.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="box"><span>Knitting</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> 
                    Since the 4D object is a rigid body rotating, and the object is continuously being projected as it rotates,
                    its projection causes a predictable warping that our brains can learn to ignore.
                </p>

                <p>Instead of seeing warping, the stream of images becomes 
                    recognizable as a rigid object rotating in 4D space.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li class="box"><span>Vision</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> Learning the 4D object through rotation gives us insights into 4D space so that we begin to intuit and 'see' 4D.</p>

                <p>What does it mean to 'see' 4D?  Recognizing 4D space as continuous,
                    the ability to determine which points are close to one another,
                    and which are far apart, the ability to determine which points are which direction from one another,
                    and the resulting ability to navigate 4D space, all combine to let us see 4D objects in 4D space.</p>
