                <p>An object in 3D space. Our example baby's object is a mobile crib. A mobile crib is a colorful spinning toy usually suspended
                    over an infant's crib that often plays music.

                <p> Our eyes can be thought of as 2D sensors that take in <strong>2D projections</strong> of our 3D world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Without developed 3D vision or depth perception, the baby views its revolving crib mobile as a continuous stream
                    of flat warping images.
                    Its toy looks different from different angles, and since the toy is rotating through different angles,
                    it appears to change shape as it
                    turns.

                <p>As the baby's brain tries to make sense of these warping images of the same object. It begins to stitch together
                    the 2D perspective projections of 3D objects.

                    </p>
                    <p>The baby with the spinning mobile crib as with other objects begins to see that the turning object
                        is not actually warping, but that it is the same continous object being viewed from different perspectives.</p>

                <p> What does it mean to "see" 3D, or have 3D vision? 
                    
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    We as humans can navigate 3D space, which means we see 3D space as continuous,
                    we can tell which points are close together and which are far apart,
                    which points are which direction from one another, and so on. The
                    combination of gauging distance and direction in 3D space
                    let us navigate 3D space, and "see 3D".

                <p> 
                    For the baby its developing intuition
                    allows it to recognize its toy from various perspectives, manipulate its toy, and successfully place
                    its toy in its mouth.

        <h3>Now we mimic the conditions that led to the baby developing 3D vision, but do so in 4D space</h3>

        <li class="box active"><span>4D object</span>

            <div class="detail active">
                <p> A virtual 4D object.                    
                </p>

                <p> We build 4D objects by embedding points in 4D space.
                    A point's location in 4D space is represented by a point vector (x, y, z, w).
                    Points in turn are represented by tiny 4D spheres.</p>

                <p>
                    So our 4D objects are point clouds made up of thousands of points arranged in geometrical patterns to form shapes.
                </p>

        </li>
        <li class="box"><span>Rotation</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> Since our 4D shapes are built as a collection of points. Applying rotations to each point rotates the whole shape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To rotate objects in 4D space we need a generic and intuitive representation for rotations which
                    we constructed as shown in the essential math section below.
                    
                </p>

                <p>Rotations in 4 dimensional space have 6 degrees of freedom. Around the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, and zw
                    planes. While rotations in 3D space have only 3 degrees of freedom - around the xy, xz, and yz planes.
                </p>

                    A perspective projection onto a 3D screen. The same way the baby saw warping 2D projections of his rotating 3D toy,
                    our technology will show you warping 3D projections of our 4D objects through a VR headset. 
                </p>

                <p>It is important to remember that in both the 3D and 4D case, the object doesn't actually warp, only its projection warps as it
                    rotates through a range of angles.</p>

        <li class="box"><span>Knitting</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> 
                    Since the 4D object is a rigid body rotating, and the object is contiously being projected as it rotates,
                    it's projection causes a predictable warping that our brains can learn through experience.
                </p>

                <p>This learning process can be described as knitting, where a stream of 3D projections becomes 
                    recognizable as a rigid rotating 4D object.</p>
            </div>

        <li class="box"><span>Vision</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> Learning the 4D object through rotation gives us insights into 4D space so that we begin to intuit and 'see' 4D.</p>

                <p>What does it mean to "see" 4D?  Recognizing 4D space as continuous space,
                    the ability to determine which points are close to one another,
                    and which are far apart, the ability to determine which points are which direction from one another,
                    and the resulting ability to navigate 4D space, all combine to let us see 4D objects in 4D space.</p>
