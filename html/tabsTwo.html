                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

                <p> Rotation of a 3D object/viewing 3D objects from different perspectives.
                    For example a baby's crib mobile spinning as the baby watches.

                    Rotations in 3D space have 3 degrees of freedom - around the xy, xz, and yz planes, using cartesian
                    coordinates.</p>

                <p> Our eyes as sensors sense a 2D projection/image.
                    The baby views its revolving crib mobile as a series of warping images.
                    To the baby without a developed sense of 3D space, the toy appears as if it is changing shape as it
                    turns.</p>

                <p>Our brain tries to make sense of these warping images of the same object. It stitches together
                    the 2D perspective projections of 3D objects.

                    The baby with the spinning mobile crib as with other objects begins to see that the turning object
                    is not actually warping,
                    but that it is the same continous object being viewed from different perspectives.</p>

        <li class="box"><span>Vision</span>
            <div class="detail">
                <p> What does it mean to "see" 3D? We can navigate 3D space, which means we see 3D space as continious,
                    can tell which points are close
                    together and which are far apart, which points are which direction from each other, etc. The
                    combination of distance and direction
                    lets us navigate 3D space.

                    This intuition of 3D space is what drives the learning algorithm that takes us from point light
                    sensors in our retina (rods and cones),
                    to seeing and imagining full continous 3D space and being able to intuitively navigate it. In the
                    baby's example this developing intuition
                    allows it to recognize its toy from various perspectives, manipulate its toy, and successfully place
                    its toy in its mouth.</p>

                <p> A virtual 4D object. It defeats the purpose of this project to try and speculate the structure of a 4D object.
                    Objects are represented by point clouds embedded in 4D space, locations in 4D space are represented by (x, y, z, w) point vectors.
                    Points in turn are represented by tiny 4D spheres.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shapes can be defined by certain properties regardless of dimension. A 4D sphere can be defined by a center and a radius
                    just like a circle in 2D or a sphere in 3D.

            <div class="detail">
                <p> Rotate virtual shapes in 4D space.  Practically a point sphere is represented by a 4 dimensional
                    position vector v like (x, y, z, w)
                    and a radius r. Applying rotations to each point sphere rotates the whole shape.</p>

                <p>
                    To rotate objects in 4D space we needed a generic and intuitive representation for rotations which
                    we constructed here(link to math).
                    Rotations in 4 dimensional space have 6 degrees of freedom. Around the XY, XZ, XW, YZ, YW, and ZW
                    planes.

                <p> 
                    Since the 4D object is a rigid body rotating,
                    it's projection causes a predictable warping that our brains can learn through experience.

                    This learning process can be thought of as a knitting, where a continous series of 3D projections becomes 
                    recognizable as a rotating 4D object.
