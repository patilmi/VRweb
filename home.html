        <h1 id="top">In Pursuit Of The Fourth Dimension</h1>
        <p>A cognitive approach to the visualization of four orthogonal spatial dimensions. This technology aims to
            expand the mind
            to intuit and navigate four dimensional space.
        </p>

        <p>If successful this groundbreaking technology answers questions like "What does a four dimensional cube really
            look like?" and
            "Can the human mind imagine four orthogonal directions?" apart from eventually opening up the world of four
            dimensional problem solving and even
            the four dimensional metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>Studying the brain as it begins to understand four dimensions is a prospect at least as exciting as
            understanding 4D itself.</p>

        <h2 id="schematic">Schematic</h2>

        <li> Conceptual - Our technology studies the algorithm that our minds use to construct 3D vision/intuition
            from point light sensory input (add hover link explaining this phenomenon) from the retina,
            and then extends it to four dimensions (Link to neural net based explanation)
        </li>
        <li>Technical - Construct virtual four dimensional shapes, rotate them virtually, render a 3D projection of them
            onto a 3D screen (VR goggles),
            view projection rendering to develop 4D intuition, manipulate the virtual 4D objects and rotations while
            viewing their projections to further
            facilitate intution. (Loss function Machine learning link).
        </li>
