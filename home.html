<h1>Four Dimensions landing page. OR IS IT BUCkET 2 INSTEAD?</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Expand mind to include spatial model/intuition/navigation of four dimensional space</p>

<h2>What/How it does</h2>
<p>Rotates a rigid body (4D cube, 4D sphere, 4D plane etc) in four dimensional space while projecting onto a 3Dimensional screen (VR headset)

    Objects created as point clouds, points represented by tiny spheres.</p>

<h2>Why it is effective</h2>
<p>It is using the same principle that the human brain uses to construct a 3D model/intuition of 3Dimensional space from 2d projections onto our retina.</p>

<h2>Signs that it is working</h2>
<p>Rotating object begins to look like a rigid body rather than a warping structure</p>

<h2>Why it is unique</h2>
<p>There are other projects looking to explore 4D with VR, these mostly operate on the principle of rendering slices of the 4D world.
    This project uses a cognitive approach that builds up our intuition organically (through rotation) while slicing loses the
    continuity that our brain needs to stitch 3D projections into a 4D whole.</p>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>Opens up the world of intuitive 4D problem solving Huge cognitive space implications:
    What is happening in the brain when we start to grasp 4D space? Brain changes? Make us smarter?
    See patterns previously invisible to us? 4D metaverse?</p>

<h2>Direction</h2>
<p>Webapplication that uses brain training app like structure, which allows users to freely manipulate objects and rotations,
     provides self testing functionality to test 4D navigational skills. Match 4D objects from different perspectives,
     Collects data from users, Time spent, session length, effects (Collaboration with cognitive research space)</p>
