<h1>In Pursuit Of The Fourth Dimension</h1>
<p>A cognitive approach to the visualization of four orthogonal spatial dimensions. This technology aims to expand the mind
    to intuit and navigate four dimensional space.
</p>

<p>If successful this groundbreaking technology answers questions like "What does a four dimensional cube really look like?" and
    "Can the human mind imagine four orthogonal directions?" apart from eventually opening up the world of four dimensional problem solving and even 
    the four dimensional metaverse.
 </p>
 <p>Studying the brain as it begins to understand four dimensions is an at least equally exciting prospect as understanding 4D itself.</p>

 <h2>Schematic</h2>
 
 <li> Conceptual - Our technology studies the algorithm that our minds use to construct 3D vision/intuition
    from point light sensory input (add hover link explaining this phenomenon) from the retina,
    and then extends it to four dimensions (Link to neural net based explanation)
</li>
<li>Technical - Construct virtual four dimensional shapes, rotate them virtually, render a 3D projection of them onto a 3D screen (VR goggles), 
    view projection rendering to develop 4D intuition, manipulate the virtual 4D objects and rotations while viewing their projections to further
    facilitate intution. (Loss function Machine learning link).
</li>
